This plugin have been developed forking [Haml and Sass syntax, indenting, and ftplugin](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1433) written by **[Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope)**, it highlight correctly 99% of the code i write.

With some work on it could be almost perfect.

### [Source MacVim](https://github.com/genoma/source-macvim)

A **#bash** script to interactively compile **MacVim** with various configurations and **[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) Python** support provided with a custom patch.

Same as [Source MacVim](https://github.com/genoma/source-macvim) but to compile Vim from source.

### [GulpStrap](https://github.com/genoma/gulpstrap)

This is a **[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)** boilerplate built with Bootstrap as a **Git module** and **[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)**.
